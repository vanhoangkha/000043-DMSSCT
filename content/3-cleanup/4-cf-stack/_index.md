1. Next, go to the [**CloudFormation console**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), and click select the **CloudFormation Stack** that you created during the workshop.
2. Click on the **Delete** button from the top right corner. CloudFormation will automatically remove all resources that it launched earlier. This process can take up to 15 minutes.
